## Portfolio Alert System

This is a small stock portfolio alert system built with Laravel and Vue. It lets users register, log in, and manage a list of stocks and lots, keeping track of purchase prices and quantities.

The system can update market prices, check for alert conditions, and highlight positions that need attention. It also includes a simple contact form so users can send feedback or questions.

To get started, install dependencies, configure your `.env` file, run the database migrations and seeders, then start the Laravel and frontend development servers.
